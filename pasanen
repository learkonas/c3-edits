Do we see art as it is or art as we are?
Jenni Pasanen believes that every person draws inspiration from this question.
“When we create art, we are creating what we’ve been through in life,” says the AI artist.
“We create who we are on the canvas.”

Raised in Finland, Jenni grew up in a creative household and has always been an artist, experimenting with various styles throughout her life from the physical – acrylic painting, clay, and sewing – to the digital, including animation and coding.
Yet, Jenni found her calling in digital art, AI, and NFTs.
Jenni was first introduced to web3 by a friend in early 2021, and she quickly realised that she had found the missing link.

“Everything clicked into place,” she revealed.
“I finally felt like I had found my niche.
I found who I am, and what I want to do.
I found my home in art.”
Jenni quit her animation and design job with Finish creative agency SEK, and became a full-time entrepreneur and NFT artist.
Her art explores the human mind, anatomy, and science, sourcing inspiration from anywhere and everywhere.

Having taken a keen interest in psychology and technology, it’s no surprise that Jenni found her style by weaving her independent study on these topics into her art.
With a background in animation in her arsenal, she combines AI (powered by general adversarial networks, or GANs) with digital art paintings, to create compelling, surreal, and mind-bending art.
“I love making art because you don’t have to follow any rules – it’s the freedom that I love about creating in web3.”

As a digital artist, Jenni faced constraints common to creators in the traditional art world.
“Before NFTs, selling digital art in its native form was really challenging and there wasn’t, and still isn’t, an easy way to do it.”
Instead, digital artists rely on commissions, forced to put up with the creative limitations that come with client work.
“Web3 and NFTs give artists the freedom to sell their art,” she says, calling on one of the most common reasons why traditional artists have moved over to web3.
For many of them, they are attracted by the ability to profit and freely create in a community where artists and collectors share a mutual relationship.
“I was drawn to web3 and the NFT community because of the amazing, supportive people, and I am very grateful for this.”

Jenni’s NFT artwork explores the realm between man and machine.
Her surrealistic style is defined by the marriage of AI and digital art, in conjunction with the human mind.
“You don’t have to create something that is real.
Art is a way to create a visual representation of what is impossible – your art makes it possible.”

“I use ArtBreeder’s tiny, pixelated images because they are unfinished and don’t resemble too much of anything.
There are more advanced functions in the tool, but this allows me to use my imagination more.”
At this point in the process, equipped with the smallest bit of inspiration from the machine-learning art site, Jenni doesn’t yet know what the piece is.
Nevertheless, she starts to tweak the base layer and build out a world, merging digital painting and AI by layering one on top of the other.

Jenni uses AI as a playground to explore unlimited imagination and inspiration, and enjoys the fact that it can alter the way that people think.
“For me, AI is not just a tool or extension of my craft – it’s my muse.”
Jenni embraces the rise of AI, rather than fearing it, fuelled by the belief that “human creativity will never stop evolving.”

Jenni’s NFT artwork evokes the wondrous and the surreal, drawing inspiration from a fascinating artistic era of the same name.
Richened by this undertone of Surrealism, she uniquely embraces the relationship between machine and human in her work.
Her collections, such as Time Eclipse and Mask Obscura, question definitions of time and reality as perceived by mankind.

As opposed to the traditional art world, web3 and NFTs attract artists through its emphasis on collaboration, building relationships, and exploring new opportunities.
“I take full advantage of every opportunity that’s available or offered to me.
When Creative Work Studios reached out to me, I knew I wanted to do something special with coding, since their team is advanced in that area.”
The collaboration with Creative Work Studios led to her Time Eclipse OpenSea collection, from which the pieces are divided into 3 primary sections: yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

“Time has always fascinated me; it is a rabbit hole of endless theories and possibilities.
It creates our past and our future,” says Jenni.
“Time Eclipse is a land of limitless opportunities and dreams up a place where time is not bound.”
The Time Eclipse collection explores the significance of fragility, and is an attempt to preserve and engulf the fleeting passage of our lives.
The collection simultaneously treats each moment as a distilled fragment of time, whilst showing how each one is linked together – for Jenni, our lives consist of a series of long and intricate moments.
Jenni’s NFTs exhibit themes of time, life, and nature, emphasised by the integration of AI.
She uses the technology to generate random shapes, which she compares to the images from a Rorschach inkblot test.
“Even if you show the Rorschach inkblot images to one million people, they all see it differently.”
Although Jenni’s artwork stems from her self-expression, one can also see themselves in it – especially in her Mask Obscura collection.
These beautiful, faceless creatures leave a lot to individual interpretation, and allow viewers to see themselves in the pieces.

The Mask Obscura is a series of beautiful beings, blending time and nature.
The collection is a collaboration between Jenni and her GAN (generative adversarial network), and is organised by four themes: seasons, elements, days, and time.
As the collection is composed of four 'acts', there are plenty more pieces to come, which allows the project to go deeper and evolve along the way.
This will permit Jenni to enhance the collection and deepen the narrative.

The faceless, masked beings in Mask Obscura explore the relationship between humanity and nature, as opposed to Jenni’s typical trope of the human mind versus AI.
The collection evokes the beauty of life, juxtaposed with the complexities that arise from time, elements, and seasons: the markers of human society.
Mask Obscura, therefore, encompasses a push and pull between the tangible and the intangible in an ethereal and thought-provoking assemblage of NFTs.
Our life experiences, personalities, and emotions build our reality and mould our perception of art.
Like the Rorschach inkblot test, one image produces seven billion outcomes; seven billion perceptions; seven billion interpretations.
This begs the question: Do we see art as it is or art as we are?
